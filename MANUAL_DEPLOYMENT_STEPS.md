# MANUAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS - CRITICAL

## Why Your Changes Aren't Live Yet

The logos and updates you see working in the admin screenshots are from your **LOCAL WORKSPACE**, but they haven't been deployed to the live site yet. 

## Current Status
✅ **All fixes are ready in**: `c:\Users\naf-d\Downloads\workspace`
❌ **NOT deployed to**: `\\NAF-PC-01\Users\naf-d\Documents\GitHub\FINALNEWAGEFRNTENDBACKNINJA24062025`
❌ **NOT pushed to GitHub** (so Netlify hasn't deployed them)

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Manual File Copy
1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Navigate to: `c:\Users\naf-d\Downloads\workspace`
3. Press **Ctrl+A** to select all files
4. Press **Ctrl+C** to copy
5. Navigate to: `\\NAF-PC-01\Users\naf-d\Documents\GitHub\FINALNEWAGEFRNTENDBACKNINJA24062025`
6. **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT delete the `.git` folder if you see it
7. Select all files EXCEPT `.git` folder
8. Press **Delete** to clear old files
9. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste new files
10. Click **Replace** for any conflicts

### Step 2: Commit and Push to GitHub
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. You should see hundreds of changes
3. Write commit message: `Deploy all critical fixes: logos, invoicing, i18n, gallery, calendar, reports`
4. Click **Commit to main**
5. Click **Push origin**

### Step 3: Wait for Netlify Deployment
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
3. Check your live site: `newagefinal.netlify.app`

## What Will Change After Deployment

### ✅ LOGOS WILL UPDATE:
- Header will show the new TogNinja logo image instead of text
- All branding updated to TogNinja theme

### ✅ FEATURES WILL BE ENHANCED:
- Invoice system with client selection dropdown
- Digital files upload/management
- New leads management with add button
- Gallery with sharing capabilities
- Translation system (EN/DE toggle)
- Calendar integration
- Newsletter management
- Reports and analytics

### ✅ ADMIN INTERFACE:
- Enhanced admin dashboard
- Better navigation
- All CRM features accessible

## If Manual Copy Doesn't Work

Try this PowerShell command (run as Administrator):
```powershell
robocopy "c:\Users\naf-d\Downloads\workspace" "\\NAF-PC-01\Users\naf-d\Documents\GitHub\FINALNEWAGEFRNTENDBACKNINJA24062025" /E /XD .git /XF .git* /R:3 /W:5
```

## Important Files That MUST Be Copied:
- `src/` folder (all React components)
- `public/frontend-logo.jpg` (the new logo)
- `public/crm-logo.png` (admin logo)
- All package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.

## After Deployment Success:
- Your live site will show the new TogNinja branding
- All admin features will work as shown in your screenshots
- The logo will be an image, not text

## Troubleshooting:
If the network path doesn't work:
1. Map the network drive first
2. Or copy to a USB drive and transfer manually
3. Or use GitHub Desktop to clone fresh and copy files there

---

**THE BOTTOM LINE**: Your changes are ready and working - they just need to be pushed to GitHub so Netlify can deploy them to the live site.
