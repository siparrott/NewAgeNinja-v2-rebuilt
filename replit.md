New Age Fotografie CRM is a full-stack web application built as a comprehensive customer relationship management system for the New Age Fotografie photography studio in Vienna, Austria. The application enables professional photography business management including client management, galleries, bookings, invoices, and various business operations through both customer-facing and administrative interfaces.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database via @neondatabase/serverless
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for images/files)
- **Deployment**: Configured for production build with esbuild

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:
- **Client**: React SPA serving the user interface
- **Server**: Express API server handling business logic
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types used by both client and server

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state (AppContext, AuthContext, CartContext, LanguageContext)
- **Routing**: React Router for SPA navigation
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for API state management
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase integration for user management
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for gallery images and documents
- **Email Integration**: Contact forms and newsletter management

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle with type-safe queries
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` for shared type definitions
- **Migrations**: Located in `./migrations` directory
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger React components
2. Context providers manage global state
3. API calls are made through service modules in `lib/`
4. Supabase client handles authentication and real-time updates
5. UI updates reflect data changes

### Server-Side Data Flow
1. Express routes receive API requests
2. Storage interface abstracts data operations
3. Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
4. Responses are formatted and returned to client

### Authentication Flow
1. Supabase handles user authentication
2. JWT tokens are managed automatically
3. Protected routes verify authentication status
4. Admin users have elevated permissions

## External Dependencies

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tooling
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
