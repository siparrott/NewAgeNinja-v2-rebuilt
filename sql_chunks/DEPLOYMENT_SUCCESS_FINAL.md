### 🎯 **Next Step: Automatic Vercel Deployment**

Since your files are now on GitHub, Vercel should automatically detect the changes and start deploying:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Find Your Project** - Look for NEWAGEFrntEUI
3. **Watch Deployment** - Should show "Building" or "Deploying"
4. **Wait for Completion** - Usually takes 2-3 minutes

### 🔍 **If Vercel Doesn't Auto-Deploy:**

1. **Manual Trigger:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - Set "Use existing Build Cache" to **NO**
   - Click "Redeploy"

2. **Import Fresh (If Needed):**
   - Go to Vercel → "Add New" → "Project"
   - Import from GitHub: `JpegWriter/NEWAGEFrntEUI`
   - Use these settings:
     - **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
     - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
     - **Output Directory**: `dist`
