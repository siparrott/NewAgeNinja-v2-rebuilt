# URGENT: TOGNINJA BLOG WRITER Assistant Integration Fix

## Problem Identified
- Backend API tests show TOGNINJA BLOG WRITER Assistant (asst_nlyO3yRav2oWtyTvkq0cHZaU) is working correctly
- Frontend browsers receive generic AI responses instead of TOGNINJA Assistant responses
- Production deployment (www.newagefotografie.com) is using outdated code or has routing conflicts

## Root Cause
The production deployment is not using the updated code with TOGNINJA Assistant integration. Multiple chat endpoints are causing routing conflicts.

## Solution
1. **Create a unique endpoint specifically for TOGNINJA Assistant** - `/api/togninja/chat`
2. **Update frontend to use the specific endpoint**
3. **Deploy the updated code to production**

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Backend API working with TOGNINJA Assistant (confirmed via curl tests)
- ❌ Frontend receiving different responses (generic AI instead of TOGNINJA)
- ❌ Production deployment needs to be updated with new code

## Next Steps
1. Create dedicated TOGNINJA endpoint
2. Update frontend to call correct endpoint
3. Ensure deployment includes latest code changes
