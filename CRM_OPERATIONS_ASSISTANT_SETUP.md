## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Assistant not responding**: Check OpenAI API key and credits
2. **Actions not executing**: Verify Supabase connection and permissions
3. **CORS errors**: Ensure Edge Functions have proper CORS headers
4. **Database errors**: Check RLS policies and table permissions

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the dashboard:
```typescript
console.log('CRM Action received:', action);
// Check browser console for detailed action logs
```

### Testing Actions
Test individual actions without the AI:
```javascript
// Test direct CRM action
handleCRMAction({
  type: 'client',
  action: 'add_client',
  data: { name: 'Test Client', email: 'test@example.com' }
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Actions
Add custom business-specific actions by extending the `executeCRMAction` function in the Edge Function:

```typescript
case 'custom':
  return await handleCustomAction(action, supabase)
```

### Integration with External Services
- Email services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
- Booking platforms (Calendly, Acuity)

### Workflow Automation
Create complex workflows by chaining actions:
```
1. Create appointment
2. Send confirmation email
3. Add to calendar
4. Generate invoice
5. Set follow-up reminder
```
