## 🛠️ Complete Fix Instructions

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and paste** the entire content from `NEWSLETTER_QUESTIONNAIRE_SETUP.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the SQL

This will create:

- ✅ `survey_responses` table (for survey responses)
- ✅ All necessary RLS policies and indexes
- ✅ Sample data for testing

### Step 2: Test Newsletter Signup

1. **Go to your live website** (frontend)

3. **Enter a test email** (e.g., `test@example.com`)  
4. **Click "Anmelden"** (Sign Up)
5. **Should show success message** instead of error

### Step 3: Verify Newsletter Shows in New Leads

1. **Go to Admin → New Leads**
2. **Should see the newsletter signup** as a new lead
3. **Form Source should be "NEWSLETTER"**
4. **Message should be "Newsletter signup - €50 Print Gutschein"**

### Step 4: Test Questionnaire Save

1. **Go to Admin → Questionnaires**
2. **Click "Create Survey"**
3. **Enter survey title** (e.g., "Test Survey")
4. **Add description** (e.g., "Testing survey functionality")
5. **Click "Save Survey"**
6. **Should save successfully** and appear in surveys list
