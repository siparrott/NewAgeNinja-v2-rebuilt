🕵️‍♂️  **Repository audit — CRM Super-Agent capabilities**

Please scan this code-base and answer each checklist item “✅ yes” or “❌ no”.
For every “yes”, cite the file + function name that implements it.
For every “no”, suggest the minimal file / stub that should be added.

**Checklist**

1. _Create client_ – Is there a tool/route that inserts into `crm_clients` with `studio_id`?
2. _Create invoice_ – Tool that inserts into `crm_invoices` (auto-pricing by SKU or custom).
3. _Make booking_ – Tool that inserts into `photography_sessions` or equivalent.
4. _Convert lead → client_ – Utility that copies a row from `crm_leads` → `crm_clients` and flags lead `status='converted'`.
5. _Reply to new leads_ – Tool that:
   • locates a lead by id  
   • calls `send_email` or `reply_email`  
   • optionally updates `status='replied'`
6. _Inbox access_ – Any IMAP / webhook / Supabase table that stores inbound e-mails (`inbox_messages`, `email_inbox`, etc.).
7. _Reply to an existing inbox thread_ – Tool that can send a message with `in_reply_to` header or thread id.
8. _Tool registration_ – Are all of the above tools exported in `toolRegistry` and included in `assistant.tools`?
9. _Policy permissions_ – Does `ai_policies.authorities` default include `"CREATE_CLIENT"`, `"CREATE_INVOICE"`, `"CREATE_SESSION"`, `"SEND_EMAIL"`, `"READ_INBOX"` (or similar)?

Please format the answer as:
