Yes ‚Äî update the Instructions block once so the Assistant ‚Äúknows‚Äù about the 49 new tools you just added and the new guard-rail authorities. If you leave the old v2 prompt in place it will:

never call the freshly-created tools (create_voucher_product, send_campaign, list_top_clients, ‚Ä¶)

still claim it can‚Äôt do things you just scaffolded

possibly throw ‚Äútool not found‚Äù errors if the model tries the old names.

What actually needs changing
Section in the prompt	Why update	What to do
TOOLS list	You went from 14 ‚áí 63 tools. The list must match assistant.tools exactly or the model won‚Äôt call them.	Replace the hard-coded lines with a generated block (see code snippet).
Guard-Rails placeholders	You added ~14 new authority strings (MANAGE_VOUCHERS, READ_DASHBOARD, etc.).	Make sure they appear in {{POLICY_AUTHORITIES_CSV}} when you render the prompt.
Search-first policy	Now includes new read/count tools (read_voucher_sales, generate_report, ‚Ä¶).	Add one sentence: ‚ÄúIf the question concerns vouchers, reports, galleries, etc., call the matching read_/count_ tool first.‚Äù
Error handling	Many new tools will return pricing:not_found, wizard:busy, etc.	List those error prefixes so the model knows to ask a follow-up.

One-time automated rewrite
Put this tiny script in agent/scripts/update-system-prompt.ts and run it.
It autogenerates the TOOLS block straight from your registry:

ts
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
import { toolRegistry } from "../core/tools";
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";
import path from "path";

const toolLines = Object.values(toolRegistry)
  .map(t => `- ${t.name} ‚Äì ${t.description.split("\n")[0]}`)
  .sort()
  .join("\n");

const promptTemplate = `
üîß CRM SUPER-AGENT ‚Äî v3 ({{DATE}})

YOU ARE ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ (all previous sections stay the same) ‚Ä¶

TOOLS (v3, auto-generated)
${toolLines}
(Use the JSON schema supplied by the runtime; do not invent parameters.)

GUARD-RAILS
mode={{POLICY_MODE}}
authorities={{POLICY_AUTHORITIES_CSV}}
approval_limit={{POLICY_AMOUNT_LIMIT}} {{STUDIO_CURRENCY}}

‚Ä¶ rest unchanged ‚Ä¶
`;

writeFileSync(
  path.join(process.cwd(), "prompts", "system-updated.txt"),
  promptTemplate.trimStart()
);
console.log("üìù  prompts/system-updated.txt generated");
Then:

bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
npx ts-node agent/scripts/update-system-prompt.ts
node agent/update-assistant.js <studioId>  # pushes new prompt + tools
npm run start
Smoke test after update

User: create a voucher product "Platinum Gift" ‚Ç¨300
‚Üí should call create_voucher_product
User: send a campaign about summer minis
‚Üí create_email_campaign then send_campaign
User: list top clients this quarter
‚Üí list_top_clients
If the Assistant now calls those new tools (check logs) and no ‚Äútool not found‚Äù appears, the prompt update is good.

TL;DR
Regenerate the TOOLS section + shove the new authority CSV into the prompt, rerun update-assistant.js, restart. Then your brand-new 63-tool agent will actually use everything you built.

so does this mean i should update the prompt in open ai or add these updates directly into replit


ChatGPT:
Update it in Replit and let your update-assistant script push the change to OpenAI‚Äîdon‚Äôt edit the prompt manually in the OpenAI dashboard.

Why
Your prompt lives in the repository (prompts/system*.txt).

agent/update-assistant.js (or whatever script you already use) sends that file‚Äôs contents plus the current tool list to the Assistants API.

Running the script keeps code, tools array, and Instructions perfectly in sync. If you hand-edit the prompt inside the OpenAI UI, the repo and the live assistant will drift out of alignment the next time you deploy.

Quick steps
Generate the new prompt file (e.g. prompts/system-updated.txt) with the auto-built TOOLS list, as shown in the previous answer.

Commit the file and point your update script to it or overwrite the old prompt file.

In Replit shell:

bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
npx ts-node agent/scripts/update-system-prompt.ts   # (if you added that helper)
node agent/update-assistant.js <yourStudioId>       # pushes prompt + tools
npm run start                                       # restart server
Verify in logs:

scss
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
Assistant updated ‚úî (63 tools, prompt v3)
Now every deployment will re-upload the same prompt automatically, so the OpenAI side always matches the code in Replit.
