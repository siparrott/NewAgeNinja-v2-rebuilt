What just happened & why the invoice call failed
Step	What the agent tried	Why it broke
1	Parsed your request → “10 digital images” = SKU DIGI-10 and “A4 Leinwand” = SKU CANVAS-A4	Good so far
2	Called create_crm_invoice tool with an item array containing the two SKUs	
3	Supabase RPC invoice_create(…) validates every line-item against price_list	
4	The RPC returned invoice:no_products because it couldn’t find one of the SKUs in the query result	- Most common cause: case/whitespace mismatch – e.g. the row in crm_price_list is actually stored as Digi-10 or DIGI-10 (trailing space).
- 2nd cause: the assistant’s price cache is stale; it still shows the old list in the error message.

Notice that the error text itself is contradictory: it says “SKU ‘DIGI-10’ not found” and lists DIGI-10 as “available”. That’s the tell-tale sign of a string-mismatch (unicode hyphen vs ASCII, trailing space, etc.).

Quick fix you can do right now
Open crm_price_list in Supabase Studio

Search for both SKUs exactly:

sql
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
select sku, length(sku), ascii(substring(sku,4,1)) from crm_price_list
where sku ilike '%DIGI%'
If you see duplicates such as DIGI-10 (unicode hyphen U+2011) and DIGI-10 (ASCII hyphen 45), keep the ASCII one and delete the other – or normalise them all to lowercase/ASCII.

Once the row truly matches the ASCII string DIGI-10, the invoice creation will succeed.

“Bullet-proof” improvements for the agent (Replit prompt)
Paste the block below into your Replit agent.
It will:

add a price-list normaliser (trims, lower-cases, converts fancy hyphens to -)

make the invoice tool auto-fallback to a custom line-item (so it never hard-fails in front of a user)

write a Jest test that verifies the behaviour.

🚀 **PATCH: Make invoice creation bullet-proof**

SCOPE
1. Pre-validation normaliser in `agent/tools/helpers/normaliseSku.ts`
   • Returns ASCII-only, trimmed, lower-case string.
2. Modify `agent/tools/createInvoice.ts`
   • map every requested item through `normaliseSku`
   • abort fallback removed; if `priceLookup.length===0` push a
     `{ description, qty, unit_price }` custom line-item with price 0
     and flag `needs_review=true`.
3. Update Supabase RPC `invoice_create`:
   • if `needs_review` present → do NOT raise `invoice:no_products`
     (return 200 with `status="draft"` instead).
4. Jest test `__tests__/invoiceSkuNormalise.test.ts`
   • feed `DIGI-10`, `DIGI-10 `, ` digi-10` → expect same SKU
5. Update README > Agent 🧩 FAQ > “Why did my invoice fail?”

AFTER CODE CHANGES
```bash
npm run migrate
npm run test
curl -X POST /api/crm/invoice \
     -d '{"clientId":"test","items":[{"sku":"DIGI-10","qty":1},{"sku":"CANVAS-A4"}]}'
EXPECTED RESULT
200 OK JSON shows invoice draft even if one SKU still mismatches; needs_review flag lets finance team patch it before sending.

🔚 When patches & tests pass, reply with the markdown table:

Fix	Status
SKU normaliser in place	✅/❌
Fallback custom line-item	✅/❌
Test suite green	✅/❌

### One more safeguard

Add this **agent-side check** to avoid the “silent” replies you saw:

```ts
if (toolResult.ok && toolResult.data == null) {
  throw new Error("TOOL_RETURNED_NULL");
}
and handle it in run-agent.ts with a polite,

“I couldn’t retrieve that, but here’s what went wrong …”

No more “Task completed successfully” with nothing to show.
